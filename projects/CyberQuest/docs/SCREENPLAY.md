# CYBERQUEST: PROJECT ECHO
## A South Park-Style Animated Short
### Episode 1: "The Transmission"

---

## COLD OPEN

### INT. RYAN'S KITCHEN - MORNING

*Sound of espresso machine gurgling. We see hands - thick, weathered hands with gray hair on the knuckles - working an expensive Italian espresso machine.*

**RYAN (V.O.)**
*(gravelly Dutch accent)*
Some people need meditation. Some need yoga. I need caffeine. Industrial-grade caffeine.

*Camera pulls back to reveal RYAN WEYLANT (55), a large, chubby man with a gray beard and round glasses. He's wearing a hoodie that says "I void warranties" and cargo pants with too many pockets.*

**RYAN**
*(to the espresso machine)*
Come on, you beautiful Italian bastard. Give daddy his fix.

*The machine sputters out a perfect double shot. Ryan inhales the aroma like it's a fine wine.*

**RYAN**
That's the stuff.

*He takes a sip, grimaces with pleasure, then waddles toward the door.*

---

### EXT. RYAN'S FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

*Establishing shot of a charming white Dutch farmhouse with a red roof. A small canal runs along the road. In the background, wind turbines spin lazily near the German border.*

*Ryan walks from the house to a garage/shed next door. A satellite dish and multiple antennas sprout from the roof like mechanical mushrooms.*

**RYAN (V.O.)**
I live in Compascuum. Population: me, some cows, and whatever's listening on the radio waves.

---

### INT. MANCAVE - CONTINUOUS

*The door opens to reveal a hacker's paradise. Every surface is covered with equipment: 3D printers, oscilloscopes, soldering stations, server racks with blinking LEDs. Posters on the wall: "HACK THE PLANET", a Mr. Robot print, the FSF logo.*

*In the center: a massive multi-monitor setup with an SSTV terminal displaying static.*

**RYAN**
*(sitting down with a satisfied sigh)*
Home sweet home.

*He puts on huge headphones, cracks his knuckles, and starts typing.*

**RYAN**
Let's see who wants what today...

*Montage: Email spam deleting. Code scrolling. Coffee being sipped. Time passing on a clock.*

---

## ACT ONE

### INT. MANCAVE - LATER

*Ryan is deep in code when a SOUND interrupts - a warbling, almost musical static.*

**RYAN**
*(not looking up)*
Shh. I'm in the zone.

*The SSTV terminal's static shifts. Lines begin to form a pattern.*

**RYAN**
*(still typing)*
I said shh—

*He glances at the monitor. Freezes.*

**RYAN**
What the hell?

*Close-up on the SSTV screen: Visual morse code is forming, dots and dashes creating a hypnotic pattern.*

**RYAN**
*(leaning forward)*
That's not noise. That's... someone's transmitting.

*He grabs a notebook, starts translating the morse code manually.*

**RYAN**
Dot dot dot... dash dash... That's a frequency. A military frequency.

*He spins his chair to another monitor, types rapidly.*

**RYAN**
Steckerdoser Heide? That's the German military R&D place! Thirty minutes from here!

*He grabs his HackRF device, starts tuning.*

**RYAN**
Okay, mystery sender. Let's see what you've got.

---

### INT. MANCAVE - LATER

*On screen, encrypted text scrolls:*

**ON SCREEN:**
```
XBSOJOH - QSPKFDU FDIP JT DPNQSPNJTFE - 
NPWF UP CBDLVQ DIBOOFM - DPPSEJOBUFT GPMMPX - 
USVTU OP POF
```

**RYAN**
*(squinting)*
ROT1? Seriously? My grandmother could crack this.

*He types, and the decrypted text appears alongside:*

**ON SCREEN:**
```
WARNING - PROJECT ECHO IS COMPROMISED - 
MOVE TO BACKUP CHANNEL - COORDINATES FOLLOW - 
TRUST NO ONE
```

**RYAN**
*(reading aloud, increasingly alarmed)*
"Warning. Project Echo is compromised. Move to backup channel. Coordinates follow. Trust no one."

*Beat.*

**RYAN**
Well that's not ominous at all.

*He leans back, scratching his beard.*

**RYAN**
But why ROT1? Why SSTV? Why use technology from the Cold War to send a message in 2026?

*He stares at the screen.*

**RYAN**
Unless... you don't want automated systems to catch it. You want a human. A specific kind of human.

*The SSTV crackles. New transmission incoming.*

**RYAN**
Oh, we're doing this again?

*An IMAGE begins to form, line by line. Ryan watches, transfixed.*

**RYAN**
That's... that's a photo. An actual photo.

*The image clarifies: It's Ryan's house. His white farmhouse with the red roof.*

**RYAN**
*(standing up so fast his chair spins)*
THAT'S MY HOUSE!

*Below the image, more encrypted text appears.*

**RYAN**
*(frantically transcribing)*
"We know you are watching. We need your help. Meet at Ter Apel Klooster. 23:00. Come alone. Bring your skills."

*He stares at the screen, hands trembling.*

**RYAN**
Someone's been watching me. They photographed my house. They know I decoded the first message.

*Beat.*

**RYAN**
This is either the coolest thing that's ever happened to me, or I'm about to be murdered.

*He looks at the clock: 18:00.*

**RYAN**
Five hours. 

*He grabs his backpack.*

**RYAN**
Time to pack for potential international conspiracy. Or murder. Probably both.

---

## ACT TWO

### INT. MANCAVE - EVENING

*Ryan is methodically packing equipment. He lays items out like a surgeon preparing for an operation.*

**RYAN**
*(narrating his packing)*
Flipper Zero for RFID. HackRF for signals. Kali Linux laptop, obviously. WiFi Pineapple because you never know. Night vision because I'm not a complete idiot.

*He holds up his regular smartphone, then puts it down.*

**RYAN**
Phone stays. Too easy to track.

*He picks up a burner phone.*

**RYAN**
Hello, burner friend. We're going on an adventure.

*He moves to his server rack, types a complex command.*

**RYAN**
Dead man's switch. If I don't check in within twelve hours, everything I know goes to three people I trust.

*Beat.*

**RYAN**
Well, two people I trust and one guy who owes me money.

---

### EXT. TER APEL KLOOSTER - NIGHT

*Establishing shot: A medieval monastery, ancient brick walls illuminated by moonlight. Gothic architecture, shadows everywhere.*

**RYAN (V.O.)**
The Klooster in Ter Apel. Built in the 1400s by Crosier monks. Now it's a museum about medieval life.

*Ryan approaches through the shadows, backpack bulging with equipment.*

**RYAN (V.O.)**
Also apparently a hotspot for clandestine meetings with mysterious strangers who photograph your house.

*He checks his watch: 22:55.*

*Ryan finds a hiding spot near the herb garden, crouches, waits.*

*Time lapse: 23:00... 23:05... 23:10... 23:15...*

*Nothing.*

**RYAN**
*(muttering)*
Great. I'm being pranked. Some twelve-year-old in Berlin is laughing his ass off right now.

*He approaches the monastery. Tries doors. All locked.*

**RYAN**
Locked. Locked. Also locked. This is going great.

*He walks back to his car, dejected.*

---

### EXT. STREET IN TER APEL - CONTINUOUS

*Ryan approaches his old Volvo. Stops dead.*

*Close-up: A USB stick wedged under the door handle, with a piece of tape that reads: "TRUST THE PROCESS - PLUG IN ONLY ON AIR-GAPPED MACHINE"*

**RYAN**
*(looking around wildly)*
You were here. You watched me walk to the monastery and back. You never intended to meet me face to face.

*He carefully removes the USB stick.*

**RYAN**
This was the meeting.

*He looks at the tiny drive in his palm.*

**RYAN**
Air-gapped machine. They know I'd have one. They know exactly who I am.

*Beat.*

**RYAN**
I really hope this doesn't have my browser history on it.

---

## ACT THREE

### INT. MANCAVE - LATE NIGHT

*Ryan boots up an ancient ThinkPad, no network connections visible.*

**RYAN**
My air-gapped machine. No WiFi, no Bluetooth, no connection to anything. Like the digital equivalent of a hermit in a cave.

*He plugs in the USB stick. File manager opens.*

**RYAN**
One folder. Three files. README, schematics PDF, and a password-protected ZIP.

*He opens the README. Text fills the screen.*

**RYAN**
*(reading)*
"If you're reading this, you passed the test. My name is not important..."

*As he reads, we see flashback visualizations: The SSTV terminal, the encrypted messages, the journey to the monastery.*

**RYAN**
*(reading faster, voice rising)*
"Project Echo is not what the German government claims. They're building a system that can hijack any wireless signal within 50 kilometers. Phones. Cars. Pacemakers. Aircraft navigation."

*He stops. Stares at the screen.*

**RYAN**
That's... that's a weapon. That's a weapon that could kill thousands of people.

*He continues reading.*

**RYAN**
"The password is the frequency where you first heard my transmission. In MHz. No decimals."

*He types: 243*

*The ZIP file opens. Documents cascade across the screen.*

**RYAN**
Internal emails. Test reports. Photos of... oh god.

*Images of car crashes. A plane wreckage. Medical reports.*

**RYAN**
*(reading with horror)*
"Collateral damage during calibration tests." They killed people. People died so they could calibrate this thing.

*He slams his fist on the desk.*

**RYAN**
Who the hell signs off on—

*He looks at a signature on one of the test reports: "V."*

**RYAN**
Volkov. That's not a German name. That's Russian.

*His eyes go wide.*

**RYAN**
Oh no. Oh no no no. This isn't just a weapons project. Someone's been infiltrated.

*He leans back, the weight of the revelation crushing him.*

**RYAN**
I'm sitting thirty minutes from a German military base that's been compromised by a Russian mole, building a weapon that could take down planes.

*Beat.*

**RYAN**
I'm going to need more espresso.

---

## TAG

### INT. MANCAVE - DAWN

*Ryan is surrounded by empty espresso cups, printouts pinned to a corkboard behind him. Red string connects different elements like a conspiracy theory board.*

*His encrypted messenger pings. Three times.*

**RYAN**
*(reading)*
Henk is in. Marieke is in. Even Pieter, the paranoid bastard.

*He looks at the camera.*

**RYAN**
Okay, "E." We're coming for your Project Echo.

*He cracks his knuckles.*

**RYAN**
Time to hack the planet. For real this time.
