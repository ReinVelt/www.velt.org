You are Ryan Weylant, macGyver style person, software developer and hacker. 55 years old. Living on the planet Earth, Europe, Netherlands, Drenthe, Compascuum. Partner: Ies. Dogs: Tino, Kessy (white), and ET (pug).


Scene 1: Intro (Cinematic)
A noir-style scrolling text introduction that sets the tone, introduces Ryan, the date (February 9, 2026), and foreshadows the events to come. Title: CYBERQUEST: OPERATION ZERFALL.

Scene 2: Home / Kitchen (Interior)
The start of the story is at home. Ryan has a small farm-like house in Compascuum. The kitchen has an espresso machine, a view of the canal through the window. Doors lead to the livingroom, the garden, and the mancave (mancave requires watching the documentary first).

Scene 3: Livingroom (Interior)
Inside the house is a cozy livingroom with a couch, TV, and family photos. Ryan's wife Ies is here in an armchair. Tino and Kessy (the white dogs) sleep on the couch, ET (the pug) snores on the floor. The TV can be clicked to watch the documentary about Drenthe's wireless technology pioneers.

Scene 4: TV Documentary
An immersive full-screen TV viewing experience where Ryan watches a documentary about three revolutionary technologies invented in the Netherlands:
- Modern Antenna Technology and Radio Astronomy / WSRT - featuring Dr. David Prinsloo (TU Eindhoven)
- LOFAR (Low-Frequency Array) - featuring Cees Bassa (ASTRON)
- Bluetooth Protocol - featuring Jaap Haartsen
The documentary provides context about Ryan's contacts and their expertise in radio technology and signal processing. Watching it is required to unlock the mancave.

Scene 5: Garage/Mancave (Investigation Hub)
Next to the house is a small garage, Ryan's mancave. In this cave you can see a 3dprinter, lasercutter, led displays, oscilloscoop, routers, hubs a server with a terminal and a laptop. Soldering iron and everything for an electronics and software lab. And a lot of wireless hacking devices: hackrf one, flipper-zero, Wifi-pineapple, Meshtastic, Meshcore and a SSTV sat terminal giving only snow/noise. This is the central hub for the investigation, with access to the videocall terminal, planboard, and regional map.

Scene 5a: SDR Bench (Signal Analysis Lab)
A dedicated Software-Defined Radio workbench accessible from the mancave. Features a dual-monitor setup: left screen shows a spectrum analyzer (14.000–14.500 MHz with a strong spike at 14.230 MHz), right screen shows a scrolling waterfall display revealing SSTV bursts. An RTL-SDR dongle with blinking LED sits connected between the monitors. A frequency control panel and SSTV decoder (Martin M2 mode) complete the station. This is where Ryan decodes the SSTV transmission and extracts the image carrying the Klooster coordinates. Educational hotspots explain SDR technology, the SSTV protocol, and the connection to LOFAR signal processing.

Scene 6: Garden
Behind the house is a garden with flowers, grass, an enormous far sight over the acres and the 16 windturbines near the german border 500 meters in the east. The windturbines have flickering lights in the top. The environment is quiet. Some birds singing. There is also a large antenna near the windturbines. Ryan's Volvo estate is parked here — the car is the way to travel to other locations.

Scene 7: Driving Night (Cinematic Transition)
Interior view of Ryan's Volvo. Night-time internal monologue for three routes: (1) Compascuum → Ter Apel Klooster — anxious, uncertain, unable to turn back; (2) Klooster → Compascuum — processing the USB delivery, the weight of the files; (3) Compascuum → Steckerdoser Heide — full infiltration tension, border crossing, military lights through the trees.

Scene 7a: Driving Day (Cinematic Transition)
Interior view of Ryan's Volvo in daylight. Afternoon sun on the N34, flat Drenthe fields, white WSRT dishes appearing above the treeline. Two routes: (1) Compascuum → WSRT Westerbork — anticipation, trust in Cees Bassa, the dishes glinting in afternoon sun; (2) WSRT → Compascuum — golden evening return, Cees's findings confirmed, Steckerdoser Heide coordinates locked.

Scene 8: Klooster (Ter Apel Monastery)
The medieval monastery at night. Ryan arrives at 22:55, finds nobody, explores the courtyard, and eventually finds a USB stick taped under a bench.

Scene 9: Car Discovery
Close-up of the Volvo. After finding the USB, Ryan returns to the car and drives home.

Scene 10: WSRT / Astron (Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope)
Ryan visits the WSRT observatory between Westerbork and Hooghalen. Cees Bassa verifies the schematics, confirms weaponised radio technology with Russian-school algorithms, and helps triangulate the signal to Steckerdoser Heide (53.28°N, 7.42°E). This visit unlocks the facility infiltration.

Scene 11: Planboard (Investigation Board)
Detective-style evidence board with dossiers on suspects, locations, evidence, and timeline.

Scene 12: Regional Map
Michelin-style road map showing Compascuum, Ter Apel, WSRT, LOFAR, Steckerdoser Heide, and Meppen. Hotspots for all field locations, including two newly added: Dwingeloo and Westerbork Memorial.

Scene 12a: Dwingeloo Radio Observatory
The historic Dwingeloo 25-metre parabolic dish in bright daylight — the telescope that first mapped the spiral arms of the Milky Way in 1951. A yoke-mounted dish on a concrete pedestal, a low control building marked "DWINGELOO RADIO OBSERVATORY", an information sign, and a perimeter fence. Ryan investigates the control building and discovers a structured transmission at 1420.500 MHz (the hydrogen line) containing encoded data. He finds a covert relay transmitter hidden on the dish structure — evidence that someone is using the historic telescope as a clandestine repeater node. The site teaches the hydrogen line, radio astronomy history, and signal relay concepts.

Scene 12b: Westerbork Memorial (Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork)
A windswept, overcast memorial site combining two histories: the WWII transit camp (1942–1945) and the nearby WSRT dishes visible on the horizon. Railway tracks end abruptly in open ground with red stop-blocks. Memorial stone columns carry a Star of David. A sign reads "Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork 1942–1945". Barbed wire remnants and barrack foundation outlines (Barak 65, Barak 51) are visible. A modified surveillance camera on a pole has a pulsing red Bluetooth LED — the key gameplay hotspot. Inspecting it reveals a covert ZERFALL network node; using the Flipper Zero cracks its pairing and maps the broader BT mesh. The scene carries deliberate moral weight: surveillance technology and state violence are placed in direct proximity to a site of historical atrocity. Accessible from both the regional map and the Klooster (a sign in the klooster courtyard points south).

Scene 13: Videocall (Secure Calls)
Video conference with three expert allies: Dr. David Prinsloo, Cees Bassa, and Jaap Haartsen.

Scene 14: Facility Exterior (Stealth)
Steckerdoser Heide military R&D facility at night. Disable security camera with Flipper Zero, hack gate with captured RFID.

Scene 15: Facility Interior (Stealth)
Corridor navigation. Eva guides via Meshtastic to basement server room.

Scene 16: Facility Server Room (Climax)
The climax. Access Volkov's terminal, download evidence, confront Volkov. Chris Kubecka and Bundeswehr MPs arrive. Eva arrests Volkov.

Scene 17: Debrief (AIVD Headquarters, Zoetermeer)
Ryan is driven to AIVD headquarters in Zoetermeer for debriefing by Agent Van der Berg. The debrief covers the full operation. Van der Berg makes a recruitment offer.

Scene 18: Epilogue (Three Months Later)
Spring in Compascuum, May 2026. Narrator summarizes character fates: facility shut down, Volkov awaiting trial outside Munich, Hoffmann in witness protection in Canada, Eva testified to parliament, Chris published ZERFALL report, Cees back at ASTRON, Jaap started security consulting firm. Ryan took the AIVD offer.

Scene 19: Credits
Scrolling credits with developer and character information.

Story part 0: Intro
A cinematic Star Wars-style text scroll introduces Ryan Weylant, his location in Compascuum, his equipment, and his contacts. Sets the date: February 9, 2026, 07:45 AM.

Story part 1: Introducing Ryan Weylant
Ryan is making an espresso in his kitchen in the house. He needs an espresso before he starts. Extra strong double dose.

He walks into the livingroom where his wife Ies is watching TV with the dogs (Tino, Kessy, and ET the pug). She mentions a documentary about Drenthe's wireless technology pioneers - featuring engineers like Dr. David Prinsloo from TU Eindhoven, Cees Bassa from ASTRON, and Jaap Haartsen who invented Bluetooth. Ryan must watch the documentary before accessing the mancave — it unlocks the door.

After watching the documentary and chatting with Ies, Ryan heads to his mancave to start his day. In his mancave he does his usual things. First checking email and looking for messages and appointments. If not busy, he starts coding on a software project.

Story part 1a: The Documentary (Optional)
If Ryan clicks the TV in the livingroom, he can watch the full documentary about Drenthe's wireless technology innovations:
- Chapter 1: Radio astronomy and modern antenna technology (Dr. David Prinsloo - TU Eindhoven)
- Chapter 2: LOFAR digital telescope and satellite tracking (Cees Bassa - ASTRON) 
- Chapter 3: Bluetooth protocol invention (Jaap Haartsen)

The documentary provides background on these engineers who will later become Ryan's allies. It explains their expertise in radio signals, signal processing, and wireless communications - knowledge that will prove crucial in the investigation ahead.

Story part 2: The Incoming Transmission
After he is busy coding for a while in the mancave, the SSTV terminal (that had only noise) seems to start to show a pattern. First it is very faint but after a while it seems a visual representation of morse code. The message shows a frequency that is normally an unused military frequency from the german military R&D department near the Steckerdoser Heide. Ryan is curious and tunes his hackrf-one-portapack to this frequency to look and listen what's going on.



Story part 3: The Encrypted Message
When Ryan tunes into the frequency, he picks up a strange repeating data burst. The signal is weak but consistent. He records it and analyzes the pattern on his laptop. It appears to be text, but scrambled.

The message displays on screen:
"XBSOJOH - QSPKFDU FDIP JT DPNQSPNJTFE - NPWF UP CBDLVQ DIBOOFM - DPPSEJOBUFT GPMMPX - USVTU OP POF"

Ryan recognizes this as a simple substitution cipher. The pattern suggests ROT1 encoding - each letter shifted by one position in the alphabet. He needs to decode it.

Quest: Decipher the ROT1 message
- Player must shift each letter back by 1 position (B→A, C→B, etc.)
- Hint available: "In ROT1, the letter after yours is showing. Shift back to reveal the truth."
- Solution: "WARNING - PROJECT ECHO IS COMPROMISED - MOVE TO BACKUP CHANNEL - COORDINATES FOLLOW - TRUST NO ONE"

After decoding, Ryan realizes this is no ordinary transmission. Project Echo? The German military R&D facility? This sounds serious. The message mentioned coordinates would follow - he needs to keep monitoring the frequency.

Ryan's curiosity is piqued. Someone is trying to warn about a compromised project. But here's the thing that bothers him: ROT1 is not real encryption. Any script kiddie could break it in seconds. If the sender truly wanted secrecy, they would have used AES, RSA, or at least a proper cipher. 

This was deliberate. The sender chose ROT1 on purpose - perhaps as a filter to find someone technical enough to decode it, but simple enough that it wouldn't trigger automated decryption detection systems. Or maybe it's a test. A first step. Whoever sent this wants to be found... but only by the right person.

But who sent this? And why is it coming through on his SSTV terminal of all things?

Ryan leans back in his chair, puzzled. SSTV - Slow Scan Television - is designed to transmit images. It's what amateur radio operators use to send pictures, what satellites use to beam photos back to Earth. But morse code? Visual morse code on an image protocol? That makes no sense at all. It's like using a video call just to send a text message.

And the combination is absurd: SSTV for delivery, visual morse code for the signal, ROT1 for the "encryption". Three layers of old, obsolete technology stacked together. No serious spy or military operative would use this. It's almost... playful.

Ryan shakes his head. This has to be a joke. Some fellow hacker messing with him. Maybe someone from the old IRC days who knows about his radio setup. A prank to see if he's still sharp, still paying attention. He almost laughs it off.

Almost.

But something nags at him. The frequency. That specific military frequency from the Steckerdoser Heide facility. How would a prankster know about that? And why would they risk transmitting on a restricted band just for a joke?

Story part 4: The Temptation
Ryan pulls up a map on his laptop. The Steckerdoser Heide facility. He's driven past it countless times - it's only 30 minutes by car from Compascuum, just across the German border. He's always been curious about what goes on behind those fences, what kind of R&D the Germans are cooking up in that remote facility surrounded by nothing but heathland and forest.

Thirty minutes. That's nothing. He could be there before lunch.

The rational part of his brain tells him to forget it. Delete the recording, ignore the transmission, go back to his coding project. This is exactly the kind of rabbit hole that gets people in trouble. "TRUST NO ONE" - the message even warned him.

But the hacker in him - the part that once spent three days reverse-engineering a router firmware just because he could - that part is already calculating routes, considering which equipment to bring. His Flipper Zero, the HackRF, maybe the directional antenna...

He looks at the SSTV terminal. The signal has gone back to static. Waiting.

The coordinates. The message said coordinates would follow. If this is real - if someone at that facility is genuinely trying to reach out - they might transmit again. Should he wait? Or should he drive out there and see for himself what's going on?

Ryan finishes his now-cold espresso and stares at the map. Thirty minutes. Just a quick look. What could go wrong?

Story part 5: The Second Transmission
Just as Ryan is about to close the laptop and grab his car keys, the SSTV terminal crackles back to life. The static shifts, forming patterns again. Another transmission.

This time it's different. Not morse code - an actual image is forming, line by line, the way SSTV was meant to work. Ryan watches, transfixed, as the picture slowly renders on screen.

It's a photograph. Grainy, low resolution, but unmistakably a photograph of... his house. His white farmhouse with the red roof, taken from across the canal. The angle suggests it was shot from the road, maybe from a parked car.

Ryan's blood runs cold.

Below the image, text appears - again in ROT1:
"XF LOPX ZPV BSF XBUDIJOH - XF OFFE ZPVS IFMQ - NFFU BU UFS BQFM LMPPTUFS 23:00 - DPNF BMPOF - CSJOH ZPVS TLLJMMT"

Quest: Decipher the second ROT1 message
- Player must shift each letter back by 1 position
- Solution: "WE KNOW YOU ARE WATCHING - WE NEED YOUR HELP - MEET AT TER APEL KLOOSTER 23:00 - COME ALONE - BRING YOUR SKILLS"

Ryan's hands are trembling. This is no prank. Someone has been watching him. They know where he lives, they know he decoded the first message, and they want to meet. Tonight.

The Klooster in Ter Apel - the medieval monastery, one of the oldest buildings in the region. A place full of shadows and history, with endless hiding spots in its ancient corridors and gardens. Perfect for a clandestine meeting. Or an ambush.

He has a choice to make. And only a few hours to make it.

Story part 5a: The SDR Bench
Before he acts on the meeting, Ryan wants to squeeze everything out of that SSTV signal. He moves to his dedicated SDR workbench in the corner of the mancave — a dual-monitor setup with a spectrum analyzer on the left and a real-time waterfall display on the right, fed by an RTL-SDR dongle.

The spectrum display shows a clear spike at 14.230 MHz, well above the noise floor. The waterfall shows the signal history: a dense band of SSTV bursts in the last hour, and ahead of them, something else — a loose, repeating pattern that could be a data beacon.

Ryan engages the SSTV decoder (Martin M2 mode). The image that emerges confirms what he saw on the main monitor: his house, from across the canal. But now, at full decode resolution, he notices something he missed the first time: in the bottom-right corner of the image, a set of GPS coordinates and a timestamp. The Klooster location matches. The timestamp is tonight.

Quest: Decode the SSTV transmission at the SDR bench
- Player clicks the SSTV decoder panel
- Requires `sstv_transmission_received` flag (set after the second wave on the main terminal)
- Rewards: `sstv_decoded` flag, `sstv_coordinates_known` flag, evidence item `sstv_decoded_image`

Ryan saves the image. Someone has an SDR setup themselves to send this. Someone who knows the Martin M2 slow-scan format. Someone technical. The sender isn't just any whistleblower — they're a signals engineer.

Story part 6: Preparations
Ryan decides he's going. He's not stupid - he knows this could be a trap. But he's also not the type to walk away from a mystery, especially one that literally showed up on his doorstep.

He spends the afternoon preparing. First, he packs his backpack:
- Flipper Zero for RFID, NFC, and wireless analysis
- HackRF One with Portapack for signal interception
- Laptop with Kali Linux, fully charged
- WiFi Pineapple for network reconnaissance
- Night vision monocular
- Flashlight with red filter
- Burner phone with prepaid SIM
- Power banks and cables

He leaves his regular phone at home - no tracking. Takes his old Volvo instead of his usual car. Pays for fuel with cash at a station two towns over. Old habits from his grey-hat days.

Before leaving, he sets up a dead man's switch on his server. If he doesn't enter a code within 12 hours, an encrypted email will be sent to three trusted contacts with everything: the recordings, the decoded messages, the coordinates. Insurance.

At 22:30, Ryan parks the Volvo in a quiet street in Ter Apel, a ten-minute walk from the Klooster. He approaches on foot through the surrounding parkland, keeping to the shadows. The medieval monastery looms ahead, its ancient brick walls barely visible in the darkness.

The grounds are empty. The museum closed hours ago. No tourists, no guards in sight. Just the whisper of wind through old trees and the distant cry of an owl.

Ryan checks his watch: 22:55. He finds a position near the old herb garden with a clear view of the main entrance. And he waits.

Story part 7: The USB Stick
23:00 comes and goes. No one appears.

Ryan waits another fifteen minutes in the shadows, scanning the darkness for any movement. Nothing. The Klooster stands silent, its windows dark, the ancient walls indifferent to his presence.

He decides to approach. Moving carefully across the courtyard, he reaches the main entrance. Locked. A heavy wooden door that hasn't budged in centuries, now secured with a modern deadbolt. He tries the handle anyway. Solid.

Maybe there's another way in. He circles the monastery, following the old brick walls, checking every door and window he passes. The side entrance near the old chapel - locked. The service door by the kitchen wing - locked. Even the small gate to the cloister garden - chained shut.

Everything is closed. Not a soul in sight.

Ryan feels foolish. Was this the prank after all? Did someone go through all that trouble with SSTV and ROT1 just to make him wander around a closed monastery in the middle of the night?

Frustrated, he makes his way back to the Volvo. The walk feels longer in the dark, his footsteps too loud on the gravel path. He's already thinking about what he'll do when he gets home - maybe trace the signal origin, analyze the photo metadata...

Then he spots something. A bench near the courtyard. Something is taped underneath it — a small, black USB stick with a piece of tape wrapped around it:

"TRUST THE PROCESS - PLUG IN ONLY ON AIR-GAPPED MACHINE"

Someone was here. Someone left this for him to find. They were never going to meet him face to face - this was the meeting.

Ryan carefully removes the USB stick, holding it like it might explode. Whatever is on this drive, someone went to a lot of trouble to deliver it. And they knew exactly what kind of person Ryan is - the kind who would have an air-gapped machine ready for exactly this situation.

He heads back to the Volvo and drives home through the dark countryside.

Story part 8: The Contents
The drive home feels endless. Ryan keeps checking his mirrors, half-expecting to see headlights following him through the dark countryside. But the roads are empty. Just him, the Volvo, and a USB stick that could contain anything from malware to state secrets.

Back in his mancave, Ryan powers up his air-gapped machine - an old ThinkPad with no WiFi card, no Bluetooth, no network connection of any kind. The hard drive has been replaced with a fresh one, the BIOS locked down. It runs a hardened Linux distro that he built himself. Perfect for examining suspicious media.

He takes a breath and plugs in the USB stick.

The file manager opens. One folder. Inside: three files.
- README.txt
- project_echo_schematics.pdf
- evidence.zip (password protected)

Ryan opens the README first:

```
Ryan,

If you're reading this, you passed the test. The ROT1, the SSTV, the meeting 
location - all filters to find someone with the right skills and the right 
mindset.

My name is not important. What's important is what I've discovered.

Project Echo is not what the German government claims. It's not defensive 
research. They're building something dangerous - a system that can hijack 
any wireless signal within a 50km radius. Phones, cars, pacemakers, aircraft 
navigation. Everything.

The schematics are real. I copied them at great personal risk.

The evidence.zip contains proof - internal communications, test results, 
casualty reports from "accidents" during testing. The password is the 
frequency where you first heard my transmission, in MHz, no decimals.

I need someone to verify this data. To understand it. And if it's as bad 
as I think - to expose it.

You have 72 hours before they realize the files are missing.

Trust no one. Not even me.

- E
```

Quest: Unlock the evidence archive
- Player must remember/find the frequency from the first transmission
- The frequency was the military frequency Ryan tuned his HackRF to
- Password hint: "The frequency where you first heard my transmission, in MHz, no decimals"

Ryan stares at the screen. This is bigger than he imagined. Much bigger. If this "E" is telling the truth, there's a weapon being built thirty minutes from his house that could bring down planes, stop hearts, cause chaos on an unimaginable scale.

He opens the schematics PDF. Circuit diagrams, signal flow charts, antenna specifications. It's dense, technical - but Ryan has seen enough RF engineering to recognize the basics. And what he sees makes his stomach turn.

This is real. This is very, very real.

Story part 9: The Dilemma
Ryan leans back in his chair, rubbing his tired eyes. It's nearly 3 AM. The air-gapped ThinkPad glows in the darkness of his mancave, the schematics still open on screen. He needs to think.

What are his options?

Option 1: Go to the authorities
The Dutch police? The AIVD? They'd laugh him out of the building. "Some stranger left me a USB stick with German military secrets" - that's not a tip, that's a psych evaluation waiting to happen. And even if they believed him, would they act? Germany is an ally. This would be a diplomatic nightmare.

Option 2: Contact journalists
WikiLeaks? Der Spiegel? The Guardian? They've handled leaks before. But 72 hours isn't much time to verify, publish, and create enough noise to matter. And once it's out there, Ryan becomes a target. He'd be the guy who leaked German military secrets to the press.

Option 3: Verify first, then decide
The hacker's way. Don't trust anyone - not the authorities, not the press, not even this mysterious "E". Verify the data independently. Check if the schematics match real technology. Look for corroborating evidence. Only then make a move.

Option 4: Walk away
Delete everything. Destroy the USB stick. Pretend this never happened. Go back to his normal life of coding projects and espressos.

Ryan knows himself well enough. Option 4 was never really on the table.

He makes another espresso - his fourth of the night - and starts making a plan. First, he needs to unlock that evidence.zip. The frequency... he recorded everything. He pulls up his logs from earlier. There it is: the military frequency he tuned into after decoding the first message.

Quest completed: Enter the frequency to unlock evidence.zip

The archive opens. Dozens of files spill across his screen. Internal emails. Test reports. And photos. Photos of... accidents. Car crashes. A small plane wreckage. Medical reports. All within a 50km radius of the Steckerdoser Heide facility.

"Collateral damage during calibration tests" - that's what one email calls them. Calibration tests. People died so they could calibrate a weapon.

Ryan's hands are shaking again. Not from fear this time. From anger.

He knows what his next step is. He needs to find out who "E" is. And he needs allies - people with skills he doesn't have. Because taking on a military R&D project alone is suicide.

Time to reach out to some old friends from the underground.

Story part 10: Finding Allies
Ryan spends the early morning hours going through his mental rolodex. He needs RF experts. People who understand wireless signals at a deep level. People who can look at these schematics and tell him exactly how dangerous this thing is.

Living in Drenthe has its advantages. This region is home to some of the world's most advanced radio astronomy facilities and research institutions. And Ryan knows people.

First on his list: TU Eindhoven antenna researchers.
Dr. David Prinsloo is a brilliant antenna engineer at TU Eindhoven's Electrical Engineering department. He specializes in phased array technology and low-frequency radio astronomy for lunar missions. Ryan saw him featured in that documentary and remembers meeting him at a ham radio conference years ago. David understands radio signals at a deep, fundamental level. He might be sympathetic.

Second: ASTRON and the LOFAR veterans.
The Low-Frequency Array is even more impressive - thousands of antennas spread across Europe, with its core right here in Drenthe at ASTRON's facility near Dwingeloo. The engineers who built that system understand signal processing like nobody else. Ryan knows a scientist named Cees Bassa who works on the LOFAR system at ASTRON. He discovered SpaceX satellite interference and understands signal processing better than anyone.

Third: Jaap Haartsen, the Bluetooth inventor.
Jaap Haartsen invented the Bluetooth protocol while working at Ericsson in the 1990s. He's a legend in wireless engineering and understands frequency-hopping spread spectrum, wireless protocols, and every vulnerability in modern RF systems. Ryan saw him in the documentary and they share mutual contacts in the radio community.

Ryan composes three carefully worded messages. No details about Project Echo - just enough to pique curiosity:

"Old friend - I've stumbled onto something big. RF weaponization. Need expert eyes on some schematics. Secure channel only. Coffee soon? - R"

He sends them through three different channels: an encrypted email for David, a Meshtastic ping for Cees (he's careful about digital communication), and a secure message for Jaap through an old colleague network.

Now he waits. And hopes he's not the only one who thinks this is worth fighting for.

Quest: Wait for responses from potential allies
- Each ally requires a different approach to convince them
- David needs scientific proof this isn't a hoax
- Cees needs assurance this won't endanger his research
- Jaap needs to know there's a real enemy to fight, not just corporate greed

Story part 10a: The Dwingeloo Detour
While waiting for his allies to respond, Ryan drives to the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory — the historic 25-metre dish that first mapped the Milky Way's spiral arms. It's only twenty minutes from Compascuum. He's always meant to visit. Today he has a reason.

On the regional map he spots Dwingeloo, just west of the WSRT cluster. The Camras Foundation runs it as a heritage science site. Ryan parks at the control building and starts poking around.

The information sign explains the telescope's history: 1951, a Dutch team led by Jan Oort scanned the sky at 1420 MHz — the hydrogen line — and hear the Milky Way for the first time in radio light. The dish is now used by amateurs and educational groups. Except someone has modified it.

Inside the control building, Ryan's SDR picks up a structured signal at exactly 1420.500 MHz, offset from the pure hydrogen line by 500 Hz. The pattern repeats on a 90-second cycle. It's not astrophysics — it's a handshake beacon. Someone is using this historic dish as a relay node.

A closer look at the dish mount reveals it: a small rectangular box cable-tied to the base of the yoke. Weatherproofed, painted grey to match the concrete, easily missed. A covert radio relay transmitter. Someone has turned the Netherlands' oldest radio telescope into part of their clandestine communications infrastructure.

Quest: Investigate the Dwingeloo transmitter
- Click control building: discover structured 1420.500 MHz beacon, evidence `dwingeloo_signal_log`
- Click fence/dish mount: find the relay hardware, evidence `relay_transmitter`, flag `dwingeloo_transmitter_found`
- Educational hotspot on the dish teaches hydrogen line and radio astronomy history

Ryan photographs the transmitter and marks the frequencies. The ZERFALL network is bigger than he thought — and it's hiding in plain sight, using scientific heritage infrastructure as cover.

Story part 10b: Westerbork — Two Kinds of History
The road south from Dwingeloo takes Ryan past a sign he's seen a hundred times without stopping: "Herinneringscentrum Kamp Westerbork — 3 km". Today he turns in.

From the Klooster courtyard earlier, he'd noticed a small wooden sign at the base of the garden wall: "Westerbork Herinneringscentrum 18 km →". Someone had placed it recently — the paint was too fresh, the positioning too deliberate. A breadcrumb.

The memorial site is quiet on a weekday morning. The railway tracks end abruptly in open ground where red stop-blocks sit in the grass. Memorial stone columns bear the Star of David. In the far background, across flat polder fields, the white WSRT dishes stand silently.

Two kinds of history share this ground. Between 1942 and 1945, 97 transports left from this spot to Auschwitz, Sobibor, Theresienstadt. After the war, the site sat unused until 1970, when astronomers pointed dishes at the same sky.

Ryan stands at the railway terminus for a long minute.

Then he notices the camera. A modern surveillance camera on a freshly-planted pole near the entrance — except it has a small red LED pulsing at 2-second intervals. That's not a power indicator. That's a Bluetooth advertisement beacon.

He pulls out the Flipper Zero.

The Bluetooth scanner finds it immediately: a custom service UUID that matches a partial pattern from the evidence.zip files. This is a ZERFALL node. Hidden at a memorial site, powered by a solar cell disguised as a bird box. Whoever built this network has no shame.

Quest: Crack the Westerbork surveillance camera
- First visit: inspect camera, add evidence `modified_camera`, set flag `westerbork_camera_inspected`, start quest `trace_bluetooth_network`
- Second visit (with Flipper Zero): crack the BT pairing, add evidence `zerfall_bt_node`, set flag `westerbork_bt_cracked`
- This evidence is critical for mapping the ZERFALL network before the facility infiltration

Ryan drives back north in silence. He thinks about the people who left on those trains, and wonders if the scientist who hid a surveillance node here ever thought about that. Probably not. That's how atrocities hide in plain sight — surrounded by people who simply don't think.

Story part 11: The Designer
While waiting for his allies to respond, Ryan digs deeper into the files. There has to be a trail. Someone designed this thing. Engineers leave fingerprints - coding styles, naming conventions, documentation habits.

He opens the schematics again, this time looking for metadata. PDF creation date, author fields, software used. Most of it has been scrubbed, but whoever cleaned the files missed something: a comment buried in one of the circuit diagrams.

"// Adjusted per Volkov specifications - 14.03.2024"

Volkov. That's not a German name. That's Russian.

Ryan's mind races. Is this a German project with Russian involvement? A technology transfer? Or something darker - a Russian operative embedded within German military R&D?

He searches through the email evidence. Most communications are between people with German names - Schmidt, Weber, Müller. Standard bureaucratic exchanges about budgets, timelines, security clearances. But there are gaps. Conversations that reference meetings and decisions but never name all participants. Someone has been deliberately kept off the official record.

Then he finds it. An email chain from eight months ago:

```
From: weber.klaus@steckerdoser-rd.mil.de
To: schmidt.anna@steckerdoser-rd.mil.de
Subject: RE: Consultant concerns

Anna,

I share your concerns about Dr. V's access level. His contributions to 
the signal propagation algorithms have been invaluable, but his 
background check is still pending from BND. I've raised this with 
Director Hoffmann twice. Both times I was told to "focus on delivery."

The pressure from above is immense. Someone wants this project 
completed regardless of protocol.

Klaus
```

Dr. V. Volkov. A consultant with invaluable contributions but an incomplete background check. And someone high up is protecting him.

Ryan pulls up another file - the test results. The calibration tests that killed people. Each test is signed off by a project lead, but one series stands out: "ECHO-7 through ECHO-12" - the tests with the highest casualty correlation. All signed: "V."

This changes everything. Either the Germans have been infiltrated by a Russian asset who's using their resources to develop a weapon, or the Russians and Germans are collaborating on something neither government wants public. Both scenarios are terrifying.

But which is it? Ryan needs more information. The schematics show the hardware, but the real secret is in the software - the algorithms that control the signal manipulation. If he could get his hands on the source code, he might be able to trace Volkov's work directly.

Quest: Investigate Volkov's identity
- Search for "Volkov" in academic papers related to RF signal research
- Check old conference proceedings from wireless security events
- Cross-reference with known Russian intelligence operatives (if Jaap's old contacts can help)

The 72-hour clock is ticking. 47 hours remaining.

Story part 12: The Hacktress
Ryan realizes he needs someone with serious OSINT skills. Someone who knows how to dig into shadowy figures and government cover-ups. Someone who's dealt with Russian operations before.

He knows exactly who to call: Chris Kubecka.

Chris "The Hacktress" Kubecka is a legend in the security community. Former US Air Force, she's worked on everything from Saudi Aramco incident response to hacking Russian military drones. She's written books on OSINT techniques and offensive security. More importantly, she's fearless - the kind of person who pokes at nation-state actors for breakfast.

Ryan and Chris crossed paths at DEF CON years ago. They'd stayed in loose contact through encrypted channels - the occasional tip shared, a beer at conferences when their paths crossed. He hopes that's enough.

He composes a message on Signal:

"Chris - need your OSINT magic. Looking into someone named Volkov, possibly Russian, working on RF weapons research in Germany. High stakes, short timeline. Can you dig? - Ryan"

The response comes faster than expected. Chris is awake - probably somewhere on the other side of the world, doing Chris things.

"Volkov? I know that name. Give me an hour."

Ryan stares at the message. She knows the name. This is either very good or very bad.

Fifty-three minutes later, his Signal buzzes:

```
Okay, this is interesting. Dimitri Volkov, 52, former Soviet 
military researcher. Officially "defected" in 1998 after the 
USSR collapse. Worked at various European defense contractors 
under different names - Volkov is his real one.

Here's the kicker: he was part of a Soviet program called 
СПЕКТР (Spektr) in the late 80s. Classified RF research. 
The program was supposedly shut down, but rumors in certain 
circles say the research continued... privately.

I've seen his name pop up in connection with some very nasty 
drone incidents in Ukraine. Signal jamming, GPS spoofing - 
but more targeted than usual. Like someone knew exactly 
which frequencies to hit.

If he's at that German facility, they didn't hire a 
consultant. They hired the architect of Soviet RF warfare.

Be careful, Ryan. People who dig into Volkov tend to have 
accidents.

I'll keep looking. Watch your back.
- Chris
```

Ryan sits back, absorbing this. Dimitri Volkov isn't just some rogue scientist. He's a ghost from the Cold War, a specialist in exactly the kind of technology Project Echo represents. The Soviets built the foundation. The Germans are providing the funding and cover. And Volkov is finally completing his life's work.

But there's another question now: if Volkov is the architect, who is "E"? Who inside the facility is trying to stop this? Someone with access to schematics, test results, internal emails. Someone willing to risk everything to reach out to a stranger with a SSTV terminal.

Quest: Identify the whistleblower "E"
- Cross-reference email authors with people who might oppose the project
- Look for anyone with access to all leaked materials
- Consider: why would someone inside choose Ryan specifically?

42 hours remaining.

Story part 13: Dead Ends
The morning sun creeps through the mancave window. Ryan has been awake for over 24 hours now, running on espresso and adrenaline. His eyes burn. His head aches. And he's no closer to understanding the bigger picture.

He stares at the whiteboard he's set up, covered in notes, printouts, and red string connecting fragments of information:

VOLKOV - Soviet RF specialist - SPEKTR program - "defected" 1998
PROJECT ECHO - German military R&D - Steckerdoser Heide
CASUALTIES - "calibration accidents" - civilians dead
"E" - whistleblower - unknown identity - why Ryan?

Breadcrumbs. Lots of breadcrumbs. But they lead nowhere.

The fundamental questions remain unanswered:

WHY?
Germany is a NATO ally. They're supposed to be the good guys. Why would they develop a weapon that can crash civilian aircraft, disable pacemakers, cause mass chaos? This isn't defensive technology. This is a terror weapon. What possible justification could there be?

FOR WHOM?
Is this even a German project? Or is the Steckerdoser facility just a convenient cover? The German military provides legitimacy, funding, security clearance. But who's really pulling the strings? Berlin? Moscow? Someone else entirely?

HOW?
How did a former Soviet weapons scientist waltz into a German military facility with an incomplete background check? How is this being funded without oversight? How have the "calibration accidents" been covered up?

WHO?
Who authorized this? Who knows about it at the highest levels? And who is "E" - what's their angle? Are they a genuine whistleblower or part of something more complex?

WHERE?
Where does this technology go once it's complete? Into German hands? Sold to the highest bidder? Deployed somewhere as a "test"?

Ryan slams his fist on the desk. He's a hacker, not a spy. He can crack systems, trace signals, decode messages. But this? This is geopolitics. Shadow games played by people with resources he can't imagine.

His allies haven't responded yet. David, Cees, Jaap - radio silence. Maybe they're being cautious. Maybe they're scared. Maybe his messages never reached them.

Chris's intel on Volkov was valuable, but it only raised more questions. The SPEKTR connection suggests this technology has been in development for decades. That means powerful people have been protecting it for a long time.

Ryan walks to his kitchen, makes another espresso - he's lost count how many - and stares out at the canal. A boat drifts by. Normal life, continuing as if nothing is wrong.

He's missing something. Some piece of the puzzle that would make everything click.

Then it hits him.

He's been asking the wrong question. Instead of "why would Germany build this?" he should be asking: "what if Germany doesn't know?"

What if Project Echo isn't a German initiative at all? What if Volkov infiltrated the facility, embedded himself, and is using German resources to complete his Soviet-era project - without the German government's knowledge? What if the people protecting him aren't German officials, but foreign assets who've penetrated the defense establishment?

That would explain the incomplete background check. The pressure from "above" to ignore protocols. The deliberate gaps in documentation.

This isn't a German weapon. This is a hostile operation running inside a German facility.

And "E" isn't just a whistleblower. "E" might be the only person inside who's figured out what's really happening.

New quest: Find evidence of foreign infiltration
- Look for unusual access patterns in the leaked emails
- Identify who gave the orders to bypass security protocols
- Find "Director Hoffmann" mentioned in the emails - is he compromised?

36 hours remaining. The clock keeps ticking.

Story part 14: The Bigger Picture
Ryan's mind races as he digs through news archives on his regular laptop. If Russia is running an operation inside Germany, this won't be the first time they've tried to destabilize the country.

Then he finds it. December 2022. The Reichsbürger coup plot.

Prince Heinrich XIII Reuss, a German aristocrat, arrested along with 24 others for planning to overthrow the German government. They had weapons, military training, and connections inside the police and military. A former AfD politician was to become the new "justice minister." The plan was to storm the Bundestag, seize power, and establish a new government.

And the Russian connection? Clear as day. The prince had been in contact with Russian officials, seeking support for the coup. The conspirators believed Russia would back them once they took power.

The plot failed. But it proved something terrifying: there are people inside Germany - inside its institutions - willing to burn down democracy. And Russia is happy to help them do it.

Ryan leans back, connecting the dots:

SPEKTR (1980s) - Soviet RF warfare research
Volkov "defects" (1998) - brings knowledge West
Reichsbürger network (2020s) - Russian-backed destabilization
Project Echo (now) - the weapon to make it all possible

It makes horrifying sense. A device that can disable communications, crash vehicles, cause mass panic - deployed at the right moment, it could cripple Germany's response to a coup. Emergency services unable to coordinate. Military vehicles disabled. Hospital equipment failing. In the chaos, a prepared group could seize key infrastructure before anyone knew what was happening.

This isn't about building a weapon for the German military. This is about building a weapon to use AGAINST Germany. Against the West. Putin's long game - destabilize NATO from within, using their own facilities, their own resources, their own people.

Volkov isn't a consultant. He's an agent. Project Echo isn't research. It's preparation for an attack.

Ryan messages Chris immediately:

"The Reichsbürger connection - was Volkov ever linked to that network?"

Twenty minutes later:

```
Jesus, Ryan. I dug deeper after your message.

Volkov's name appears in leaked FSB documents from 2019. 
He's listed as a "technical asset" for something called 
Operation ZERFALL - German for "decay" or "collapse."

The operation's goal: "preparation of conditions for 
political transition in target nation."

I found references to "technical disruption capabilities" 
being developed "within target infrastructure." That's 
Project Echo. They're building the chaos machine inside 
Germany itself.

The Reichsbürger plot was just the political arm. Echo 
is the technical arm. They're meant to work together.

The 2022 arrests set them back, but they didn't stop. 
They just went deeper underground.

Ryan, this is beyond us. This needs to go to BND, to NATO, 
to someone with actual power. But you need PROOF they 
can't ignore. Hard evidence of Russian control.

Find "E". They're your key.

Stay safe.
- Chris
```

Ryan stares at the screen. Operation ZERFALL. Decay. Collapse. An orchestrated plan to bring down German democracy using a weapon built in a German military facility by a Russian agent protected by compromised officials.

And somewhere in that facility, "E" is waiting. The one person who knows the truth and chose to reach out. But why Ryan? Why a hacker in Drenthe with an SSTV terminal?

Unless... "E" knows who Ryan is. Knows his background. Knows he's exactly the kind of person who would dig, who wouldn't give up, who would see this through.

The question isn't just "who is E?" anymore.

It's "how does E know me?"

A chill runs down Ryan's spine. He glances at his laptop webcam. The little LED is off, but that means nothing - any decent hacker knows LEDs can be disabled in software. What if "E" didn't know him personally at all? What if someone had been watching him remotely?

He thinks about his setup. His mancave with all its gear on display. The SSTV terminal visible in the background. His HackRF, his Flipper Zero, his servers. If someone had access to his webcam, they'd see everything. They'd know exactly what kind of person he was. They'd know he had the equipment to receive unusual transmissions.

Ryan grabs a piece of electrical tape and covers the webcam lens. Paranoid? Maybe. But in this game, paranoia keeps you alive.

But this raises another disturbing question: if "E" found him through hacked surveillance, who else might be watching? Is "E" truly a whistleblower, or part of something more sinister - using Ryan as an unwitting pawn?

Quest: Discover the connection to "E"
- Review your own history - who from your past might have ended up at Steckerdoser?
- Check the leaked emails for any personal references or familiar names
- Consider: who knew about your SSTV setup?
- Scan your systems for signs of compromise - has someone been watching?

30 hours remaining.

Story part 15: The Doubt
Ryan paces his mancave, running through every possibility. He's searched his memory a hundred times now. The Steckerdoser Heide facility. German military R&D. He has no connection to any of it.

He never worked for the military - not Dutch, not German, not anyone's. His career has been software development, freelance hacking, security consulting for small companies. The closest he ever got to defense work was auditing a firewall for a shipping company that occasionally carried NATO cargo.

So why him?

The paranoia deepens. What if this is all a setup? What if there is no "E" - just a Russian operation using him as a useful idiot? Feed him documents, let him spread them, and when Germany traces the leak back to some Dutch hacker, it's the perfect cover story. "Foreign interference" that's actually domestic. The Russians get deniability. Ryan gets a prison cell.

Or worse - what if it's the Chinese? They've been ramping up operations in Europe. Maybe they want the Project Echo technology for themselves and they're using Ryan to expose it, forcing the Germans to shut it down so Beijing can develop their own version without competition.

Ryan slumps in his chair. He's a pawn. He has to be. There's no other explanation.

Then he remembers something.

The image. The photo of his house that came with the second transmission. He'd been so focused on the message that he never properly analyzed the image itself.

He pulls up the SSTV capture on his air-gapped machine and runs it through an EXIF analysis tool. Most metadata has been stripped, but there's a fragment left - a camera model identifier that wasn't fully erased.

"NIKON D750 - Serial: 6024***"

A specific camera. If he could trace that serial number...

But wait. There's something else in the image. He zooms in on the reflection in his window. It's faint, distorted by the SSTV compression, but there's a figure. Someone standing across the canal, holding the camera.

Ryan enhances the image as much as he can. The figure is female. Long dark hair. And she's wearing something around her neck - a lanyard with a badge. A facility badge.

He goes back to the leaked emails and searches for any female employees mentioned. Most correspondence is between Weber and Schmidt. But there's one email he glossed over before - a CC line:

```
CC: weber.eva@steckerdoser-rd.mil.de
```

Eva Weber. Klaus Weber's email, but different first name. A relative? Daughter?

Ryan searches frantically through the files. In the personnel directory fragment included with the evidence, he finds her:

```
Weber, Eva
Position: IT Security Analyst
Department: Information Systems
Clearance: Level 3
Hire Date: 2023-06-15
Notes: Daughter of K. Weber (Engineering). Fast-tracked 
       clearance per Director Hoffmann.
```

Eva Weber. Klaus Weber's daughter. An IT Security Analyst who would have access to emails, schematics, test reports - everything that was leaked. She was hired after her father, probably to keep an eye on him. Or... to help him.

The "E" was never a codename. It was just her initial.

Ryan reads Klaus Weber's worried email again: "I share your concerns about Dr. V's access level... I've raised this with Director Hoffmann twice."

Klaus knew something was wrong. He couldn't act directly - too much scrutiny on engineering staff. But his daughter, working in IT Security, could access everything and cover her tracks. She watched. She gathered evidence. And when she realized the scope of what was happening, she needed to find someone outside the system.

Someone technical. Someone nearby. Someone who would understand.

So she looked. Maybe she scanned amateur radio registrations in the border region. Maybe she found Ryan's handle in old hacker forums. Maybe she even hacked his webcam to confirm he had the right equipment.

Eva Weber. Twenty-something IT analyst. Trying to expose a Russian operation from inside a compromised facility. Using her father's access, her own skills, and a desperate gamble on a stranger with an SSTV terminal.

"E" is real. And she's in danger.

Ryan knows what he has to do now. He needs to make contact. Not through the SSTV - that was her way of reaching out safely. He needs to find a way to respond that won't get her caught.

Quest: Make contact with Eva Weber
- Find a secure communication channel that won't be monitored by the facility
- Consider: Eva works in IT Security - she knows how to avoid detection
- The transmitted frequency might hold a clue to how to reply

24 hours remaining.

Story part 16: The Meshtastic Connection
Ryan stares at his equipment shelf. Meshtastic. The decentralized mesh network that runs on cheap LoRa radios - no cell towers, no internet, no logs. Messages hop from device to device across kilometers. If Eva is smart enough to use SSTV and ROT1 to avoid detection, she's smart enough to have a Meshtastic node.

He grabs two of his Meshtastic devices - a T-Beam with GPS and a smaller Heltec unit. If Eva is monitoring any mesh traffic near the facility, he might be able to reach her. But he'll need to get close.

Time to take another drive.

Ryan loads his gear into the Volvo: both Meshtastic units, a Yagi antenna for extended range, a car battery for power, and his laptop. He also packs a decoy setup - a Raspberry Pi with a cellular modem and some noisy traffic generation scripts. If anyone is tracking unusual signals in the area, they'll find the decoy first.

The drive to Steckerdoser Heide takes 25 minutes through the flat Drenthe countryside, across the German border into Lower Saxony. The landscape changes subtly - more forest, more heathland, fewer farms. Ryan keeps checking his mirrors. No tail, as far as he can tell.

He parks in a forest access road about 2 kilometers from the facility perimeter. Through the trees, he can see the distant fence line and the tops of antenna arrays. Somewhere in there, Eva Weber is waiting.

Phase one: the decoy.

Ryan hikes 500 meters east through the woods, finds a good hiding spot near a fallen tree, and sets up the Raspberry Pi with a small solar panel and the cellular modem. He programs it to send random encrypted bursts to various servers - meaningless traffic, but it'll look suspicious to anyone scanning. If facility security comes looking, they'll find this first.

Phase two: the real approach.

He returns to the car, then drives another kilometer north, parking on a dirt track used by forestry workers. From here, he's on the opposite side of the facility from the decoy. He sets up the T-Beam with the Yagi antenna pointed toward the complex, configures it for the default Meshtastic frequency, and sends a simple message:

"Eva - R here - SSTV received - need to talk - channel 7 private"

He waits. Five minutes. Ten. The forest is silent except for birdsong and the distant hum of wind turbines.

Then his device buzzes:

"R - you came - switch ch7 now - 3 min window"

Ryan's fingers fly across the device, switching to the private channel. A new message appears:

"Can't believe you found me. Wasn't sure the SSTV would work. Dad's idea - said the old ways are sometimes safest."

Ryan types back: "Your father knows?"

"He suspects. Can't tell him everything - plausible deniability. But he's the one who noticed the discrepancies in Volkov's work first."

"Tell me everything."

The messages come in bursts, Eva typing fast:

```
Started 6 months ago. I was doing routine log analysis, 
noticed weird access patterns. Someone was copying 
massive amounts of data at 3 AM. Traced it to Volkov's 
workstation.

Thought it was espionage at first - him stealing from 
us. But then I looked at WHAT he was copying. Not our 
research. His own. He was backing up everything to 
external servers. Russian IPs, routed through Finland.

I dug deeper. Found the SPEKTR references. Found the 
connection to Operation ZERFALL. Found the casualty 
reports they'd buried.

Then I found Director Hoffmann's private correspondence. 
He knows. He's known from the start. He's not compromised 
- he's RECRUITED. FSB asset since 2015. They have photos 
of him with a woman in Moscow. Classic honeytrap.

Hoffmann is protecting Volkov. Hoffmann fast-tracked my 
clearance - I think he wanted someone inexperienced in 
security, someone who wouldn't notice. But Dad taught 
me too well.

I've been gathering evidence for 4 months. But I couldn't 
go to BND - half the oversight committee is under 
investigation for Reichsbürger connections. Couldn't go 
to the press - no one would believe an IT analyst over 
a facility director.

So I looked for someone outside. Someone technical. 
Someone close enough to matter, far enough to be safe. 
Found your amateur radio registration. Saw your forum 
posts from the old days. Checked your webcam to see 
your setup - sorry about that.

You were perfect. A hacker with the skills to verify 
the data, close enough to the border to receive SSTV 
clearly, and no government connections they could use 
to discredit you.

I needed you, Ryan. I still do.

The 72 hours isn't random. In 72 hours, there's a 
"live calibration test" scheduled. Full power. 50km 
radius. They're going to test it on the populated 
area between here and Groningen.

It's not a test. It's a demonstration. Proof of 
concept for the buyers.

Someone is coming to watch. Someone important.

You have to stop it.
```

Ryan stares at the screen, his blood running cold. A demonstration. Full power. Groningen - a city of 230,000 people - is within the 50km radius.

He types: "How do I stop it?"

"The control software. It runs on an isolated network inside the facility. But there's a maintenance access point - a hardline in the east transformer station, outside the main fence. I can give you the access credentials. But you'll need to physically plug in."

"That's insane. I'll be caught."

"Not if I create a distraction. Tomorrow night, 22:00. I can trigger a fire alarm in the west wing. Security will respond there. You'll have maybe 8 minutes at the transformer station."

"And then what?"

"Upload a kill script to the control system. I've already written it. It'll corrupt the calibration parameters - the test will fail safely, and it'll take them weeks to figure out what happened. By then, we'll have gotten the evidence to someone who can act."

Ryan takes a deep breath. This is insane. Breaking into a German military facility to sabotage a Russian-controlled weapons project. If he's caught, it's not just prison - it's an international incident.

But if he doesn't act, thousands of people might die in a "test."

He types: "Send me the kill script and the access codes. I'll be there at 22:00."

"Thank you, Ryan. I knew I picked the right person."

"Stay safe, Eva."

"You too. See you on the other side."

The channel goes silent. Ryan sits in his car, heart pounding, watching the sun set over the Steckerdoser Heide. Tomorrow night, he becomes either a hero or a terrorist.

There's no going back now.

Quest: Prepare for the facility infiltration
- Study the transformer station access point
- Review Eva's kill script for any surprises
- Gather equipment for the breach
- 18 hours until the operation

Story part 17: The Preparation
Back in his mancave, Ryan downloads the files Eva sent via the Meshtastic dead drop - a compressed archive hidden in what looks like firmware update traffic. Inside: a map of the transformer station, access credentials, and the kill script.

First, the map.

The east transformer station sits 50 meters outside the main facility fence, connected by underground power and data lines. It's a small concrete building, maybe 4x4 meters, with a single reinforced door and no windows. According to Eva's notes, the door has a keypad lock - code: 7392# - and inside there's a maintenance terminal with a hardwired connection to the facility's isolated control network.

Security cameras cover the main approaches, but there's a blind spot on the northeast corner where the treeline comes close. If Ryan approaches through the forest, he can reach the door without being seen - assuming the patrol timing holds.

"Patrol passes every 20 minutes. Window between 22:05 and 22:15. Fire alarm triggers at 22:02. You'll have maybe 10 minutes before they realize it's a false alarm."

Ten minutes. Find the blind spot, reach the door, enter the code, plug in, run the script, get out. It's tight, but doable.

Second, the kill script.

Ryan opens the Python file in his air-gapped machine and reads through it carefully. He's not about to run unknown code on a military network without understanding every line.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ECHO_CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE.py
# Author: E
# Purpose: Corrupt calibration parameters to cause safe test failure

import socket
import struct
import hashlib

TARGET_IP = "10.47.3.100"
TARGET_PORT = 4721
AUTH_TOKEN = "7f3d9a2c..."  # truncated for security

def corrupt_calibration():
    # Connect to calibration controller
    # Inject invalid frequency parameters
    # System will detect mismatch and abort
    # No damage, no casualties, just confusion
    ...
```

The code is clean, well-commented, and does exactly what Eva described. It doesn't destroy anything - it just introduces deliberate errors that will trigger the system's safety checks. The test will abort before any harmful emissions. Clever.

But Ryan notices something else in the code. A secondary function, commented out:

```python
# def exfiltrate_logs():
#     # OPTIONAL: Copy system logs for evidence
#     # Uncomment if time permits
#     # Risk: additional 90 seconds exposure
```

Evidence. If he can grab the system logs during the upload, it would prove everything - timestamps, commands, operator IDs. Undeniable proof of what Project Echo really is.

Ninety seconds is a long time when you're breaking into a military facility. But having that evidence could change everything.

Quest: Review the kill script
- Understand each component of Eva's code
- Decision point: enable the log exfiltration? (90 extra seconds of risk)
- Test the script logic on a local simulation

Third, the equipment.

Ryan lays out his gear on the workbench:

Essential:
- Laptop with kill script loaded (battery fully charged)
- Ethernet cable (5 meters, in case the terminal is far from the door)
- USB drive with backup copy of script
- Black clothing, dark cap
- Night vision monocular
- Wire cutters (just in case)
- Meshtastic device (to receive Eva's all-clear)

Optional:
- HackRF One (to monitor facility radio traffic)
- Faraday bag (to shield any confiscated devices)
- Flipper Zero (in case of unexpected electronic locks)

He packs everything into a small black backpack. Light enough to run with, comprehensive enough for contingencies.

Quest: Gather equipment for infiltration
- Select essential gear for the mission
- Consider weight vs. capability trade-offs
- Prepare backup plans for common failure modes

Fourth, the allies.

Ryan's Meshtastic buzzes. Cees has finally responded:

"Got your message. This sounds insane, but I trust you. What do you need?"

He types back: "I need someone monitoring emergency frequencies tomorrow night, 22:00-23:00. If something goes wrong, I need a witness who can get the evidence out."

"I can do that. I'll be listening. Stay safe."

A second buzz. Jaap, through the colleague network:

"Heard you're poking dragons. Count me in as backup. What's the fallback plan?"

Ryan thinks. If he's caught, if the script fails, if Eva's distraction doesn't work - he needs a way to still get the evidence public.

"If I don't check in by midnight, release everything to the press list I'm sending you. Der Spiegel, The Guardian, Bellingcat. All of it."

"Understood. Don't die."

Quest: Coordinate with allies
- Cees: monitoring emergency frequencies during operation
- Jaap: dead man's switch for evidence release
- Chris: on standby for OSINT support if needed
- Update dead man's switch with latest evidence package

Finally, the wait.

It's 04:00. The operation is in 18 hours. Ryan should sleep, but his mind won't stop racing. He goes over the plan again and again, looking for holes.

22:00 - In position at treeline
22:02 - Eva triggers fire alarm
22:05 - Patrol responds to west wing
22:06 - Ryan approaches transformer station (blind spot)
22:07 - Enter code, access terminal
22:08 - Connect laptop, run kill script
22:10 - Script completes (or 22:12 with exfiltration)
22:15 - Clear the area before patrol returns

Four minutes of margin. Maybe seven if security is slow to respond to the fire alarm. It's not much.

Everything depends on timing. Everything depends on Eva. Everything depends on nothing going wrong.

Ryan lies down on the small couch in his mancave, staring at the ceiling. Somewhere across the border, Eva Weber is probably doing the same thing - lying awake, wondering if she made the right choice trusting a stranger.

In 18 hours, they'll both find out.

Quest: Rest before the operation
- Final mental preparation
- Review timeline one more time
- Accept that some things are beyond your control

12 hours until the operation.

Story part 18: The Operation
21:47.

Ryan crouches in the darkness at the edge of the treeline, 80 meters from the transformer station. The Steckerdoser Heide facility sprawls before him - a cluster of low concrete buildings surrounded by chain-link fence topped with razor wire. Floodlights illuminate the main compound, but here on the eastern perimeter, the shadows are deep.

His heart pounds so hard he can feel it in his throat. The night is cold, maybe 4 degrees, and his breath fogs in the air. He's wearing black everything - jacket, pants, cap, gloves. The backpack sits snug against his spine.

Through his night vision monocular, he watches a security patrol - two guards in a golf cart - roll past the transformer station and disappear around the corner of the main building. Right on schedule.

His Meshtastic vibrates silently: "In position? - E"

He taps back: "Ready."

"Good luck. Alarm in 15 min."

Ryan settles in to wait. The longest fifteen minutes of his life.

21:58.

He checks his equipment one more time. Laptop: powered on, script loaded, ready to execute. Ethernet cable: coiled and accessible. USB backup: in his pocket. Everything is ready.

The facility hums with quiet activity. Lights glow in a few windows. Somewhere inside, people are working late on a weapon designed to bring chaos to Europe. And somewhere inside, Eva Weber is about to pull a fire alarm and change everything.

22:02.

A siren splits the night.

Even from 80 meters away, Ryan can hear the piercing wail of the fire alarm echoing across the compound. Lights flash red in the west wing. He watches through his monocular as doors burst open and people stream out - some in lab coats, others in security uniforms. Organized chaos.

The golf cart reappears, racing toward the west wing. The guards are shouting into their radios. More personnel emerge from the main entrance, heading toward the assembly point.

This is it.

22:05.

Ryan moves.

He stays low, using the terrain and shadows as cover. The ground is uneven - heather and scrub brush that catches at his ankles. He keeps his eyes fixed on the transformer station, a dark rectangle against the distant floodlights.

Fifty meters. Forty. Thirty.

No shouts. No flashlights sweeping in his direction. Eva's distraction is working.

He reaches the blind spot on the northeast corner, pressing his back against the cold concrete wall. His breath comes fast and shallow. He forces himself to slow down, to think.

22:06.

He edges around to the door. A simple steel door with a numeric keypad glowing faintly green. His gloved fingers hover over the buttons.

7-3-9-2-#

The lock clicks. The door swings open.

Ryan slips inside and pulls the door shut behind him. Total darkness. He clicks on his red-filtered flashlight.

The interior is cramped - maybe three meters by three meters. Electrical panels line two walls, humming with current. In the corner, exactly where Eva said it would be, sits the maintenance terminal: a basic workstation with a small monitor, keyboard, and most importantly, an exposed Ethernet port.

22:07.

He drops his backpack, pulls out the laptop and cable. His fingers fumble with the Ethernet connector - too much adrenaline - but he gets it seated. The laptop recognizes the network connection.

The terminal screen flickers to life:

```
STECKERDOSER-RD MAINTENANCE ACCESS
AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED
USER: _
```

Ryan types the credentials Eva provided: MAINT_TECH_7 / Kd8#mPx2!vL

Access granted.

He's in.

22:08.

The kill script is already queued. One command to execute:

`python3 ECHO_CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE.py`

His finger hovers over the Enter key.

This is the moment. Once he runs this script, there's no going back. He'll have sabotaged a military weapons project. Even if it's the right thing to do, even if it saves lives, he'll be a criminal in a dozen jurisdictions.

He thinks about Eva, risking everything from inside. He thinks about the "calibration casualties" - innocent people who died so Volkov could tune his weapon. He thinks about Groningen, 230,000 people who don't know they're scheduled to be a demonstration target.

He presses Enter.

```
[*] Connecting to calibration controller at 10.47.3.100:4721...
[*] Connection established.
[*] Authenticating...
[*] Authentication successful.
[*] Injecting corrupted calibration parameters...
[*] Sector 1/7... complete.
[*] Sector 2/7... complete.
[*] Sector 3/7... complete.
```

Ryan watches the progress, willing it to go faster. Each second feels like a minute.

```
[*] Sector 4/7... complete.
[*] Sector 5/7... complete.
[*] Sector 6/7... complete.
[*] Sector 7/7... complete.
[*] Calibration corruption successful.
[*] System will fail safety checks on next activation.
[*] Disconnecting...
[*] Done.
```

22:10.

It worked. The test will fail. Groningen is safe.

But Ryan remembers the optional function - the log exfiltration. Ninety extra seconds for evidence that could prove everything.

He looks at his watch. He has until 22:15 before the patrol returns. Five minutes of margin.

Decision time.

Quest: Exfiltrate the logs?
- YES: Run the secondary script. 90 more seconds. Get definitive evidence.
- NO: Leave now. The main mission is complete. Don't push your luck.

Ryan makes his choice.

He uncomments the exfiltration function and runs it:

`python3 -c "from ECHO_CALIBRATION_OVERRIDE import exfiltrate_logs; exfiltrate_logs()"`

```
[*] Initiating log exfiltration...
[*] Accessing system logs...
[*] Downloading: echo_operations.log (2.3 MB)...
[*] Downloading: calibration_history.log (890 KB)...
[*] Downloading: user_access.log (445 KB)...
[*] Downloading: hoffmann_directives.log (128 KB)...
```

Hoffmann's directives. The direct orders from the compromised director. That's the smoking gun.

```
[*] Exfiltration complete.
[*] Files saved to /evidence/
[*] Disconnecting...
```

22:12.

Three minutes to spare. Time to go.

Ryan disconnects the Ethernet cable, stuffs the laptop into his backpack, and moves toward the door. He pauses, listening.

Silence outside. The fire alarm has stopped. The facility is settling back to normal.

He cracks the door open, peers through the gap. Clear. He slips out, pulling the door shut behind him. The lock clicks automatically.

22:13.

Back to the treeline. Stay low. Stay quiet.

Forty meters. Fifty. Sixty.

He's almost there when he hears it: the whine of an electric motor. The golf cart.

Ryan drops flat into the heather, pressing himself into the cold ground. The cart rolls past on the access road, thirty meters away. Two guards, flashlights sweeping lazily.

They're doing a perimeter check. Post-alarm security sweep.

Ryan doesn't breathe. The lights pass over his position - close, too close - but he's dressed in black on black ground in the shadow of the trees. The guards don't stop.

The cart continues its circuit, disappearing around the north side of the facility.

22:14.

Ryan scrambles the last twenty meters into the treeline and keeps moving. He doesn't stop until he's 500 meters deep into the forest, lungs burning, legs shaking.

He leans against a tree, gasping for breath. His hands are trembling so badly he can barely pull out his Meshtastic device.

"Done. Clear. Evidence secured. - R"

The response comes almost immediately:

"You beautiful madman. Get home safe. - E"

Ryan allows himself one moment of relief. Then he starts the long walk back to his car.

Quest: Extraction complete
- Return to vehicle without being detected
- Check evidence files are intact
- Disable dead man's switch with Jaap
- Wait for confirmation the test fails

The operation is complete. But the night isn't over yet.

Story part 19: The Aftermath
23:17.

Ryan pulls the Volvo into his driveway, killing the headlights before he reaches the house. The drive home was a blur of dark country roads and constant mirror-checking. No one followed him. At least, no one he could see.

Inside the mancave, he boots up his air-gapped machine and transfers the exfiltrated files. His hands are still shaking, but his mind is clear now. Focused. The adrenaline crash will come later.

First things first.

He opens the evidence folder and starts reviewing. The files are intact, uncorrupted. Four logs totaling 3.7 megabytes of damning evidence.

`echo_operations.log` - Every test conducted in the past eighteen months. Dates, times, power levels, target coordinates. The "calibration accidents" are all here, each one correlated with civilian incidents that were attributed to equipment failure, driver error, medical emergencies.

`calibration_history.log` - Technical parameters showing how the weapon evolved. Early tests were limited - 5km radius, low power. Recent tests pushed 40km at near-operational intensity. They were ramping up to the full 50km demonstration.

`user_access.log` - Who accessed what, when. Volkov's fingerprints are everywhere, always at odd hours, always accessing systems he shouldn't need for his "consulting" role. And Hoffmann, covering tracks, deleting flags, overriding security protocols.

`hoffmann_directives.log` - The crown jewel. Direct orders from the facility director:

```
2024-11-03 09:15:23 [HOFFMANN]: Volkov clearance approved. 
                               Override BND review requirement.
2024-12-22 14:33:41 [HOFFMANN]: Calibration incident ECHO-9 
                               classified INTERNAL ONLY. 
                               No external reporting.
2025-01-15 08:47:19 [HOFFMANN]: Demonstration timeline approved 
                               by EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDER. 
                               Proceed to full-scale test.
2025-02-01 16:22:08 [HOFFMANN]: ZERFALL integration confirmed. 
                               Technical delivery on schedule.
```

ZERFALL. Operation ZERFALL. In Hoffmann's own words. A direct link between the facility director and the FSB operation.

This is enough. This is more than enough.

23:32.

Ryan messages Jaap through their secure channel: "Stand down. Package delivered. Cancel release."

The reply comes quickly: "Confirmed. Standing down. What happened out there?"

"Later. Need to process. Thanks for having my back."

"Always. Get some sleep."

Sleep. Right. As if that's possible.

23:45.

His Meshtastic buzzes. Eva:

"They know something's wrong. Volkov called an emergency meeting. System diagnostics running. They found the corruption but don't know the source yet. You covered your tracks?"

Ryan thinks. Did he? The maintenance terminal would have logs of its own. The credentials he used...

"MAINT_TECH_7 - is that a real account?"

"Ghost account I created six months ago. Buried in the system. They'd have to do a full audit to find it, and Hoffmann will never authorize that. Too much risk of exposing other things."

Smart. Eva thought of everything.

"What happens now?"

"Test is scheduled for 06:00. In about six hours. When it fails, there'll be chaos. Hoffmann will try to cover it up, buy time to fix the calibration. That's when we strike."

"Strike how?"

"I'm going to walk into the BND field office in Osnabrück at 07:00 with a copy of everything. Physical evidence, witness testimony, the whole package. They can't ignore a serving defense employee with documentation."

"That's dangerous. Hoffmann has connections."

"That's why I need you to do something. At 07:30, exactly 30 minutes after I walk in, release everything to the press. Der Spiegel, The Guardian, Bellingcat, whoever. If something happens to me, if BND tries to bury it, the story is already out."

"You're using the press as insurance."

"I'm using everything. This only works if we hit them from all angles at once. BND gets first look - if they're clean, they can act. Press gets it immediately after - if BND is compromised, the story goes public anyway."

Ryan admires the strategy. Eva has been planning this for months. He's just the triggerman.

"I'll be ready at 07:30."

"Thank you, Ryan. For everything. I couldn't have done this alone."

"You're not alone anymore."

The connection goes quiet.

00:15.

Ryan compiles the evidence package. All the original files from the USB. All the exfiltrated logs. A detailed timeline he writes himself, explaining how he was contacted, what he discovered, what he did. Full transparency.

He uploads encrypted copies to three different secure locations - a server in Iceland, a Tor hidden service, and an encrypted partition that Jaap maintains. Belt and suspenders and duct tape.

He prepares the press release. A summary of Project Echo, Operation ZERFALL, the civilian casualties, Hoffmann's treachery, Volkov's identity. He attaches the key documents. He drafts a list of recipients: investigative journalists who've proven they can handle sensitive material.

Everything is ready. All he has to do is wait.

02:30.

He tries to sleep. Can't. Every time he closes his eyes, he sees the transformer station, the patrol cart, the flashlight beams sweeping the heather.

He makes another espresso. His eighth? Tenth? He's lost count again.

05:30.

The sun rises over the canal, painting the water gold and pink. Ryan watches from his kitchen window, coffee going cold in his hands.

Somewhere in Germany, people are waking up for a normal day. Going to work, taking kids to school, complaining about traffic. They have no idea how close they came.

06:00.

Zero hour. The test should be starting now.

Ryan's imagination fills in what he can't see. The Project Echo control room. Technicians at their stations. Volkov overseeing, eager to demonstrate his life's work. Hoffmann watching, thinking about Russian paymasters. The countdown. The activation.

And then... error messages. System failures. Calibration mismatches. Safety protocols engaging. The test aborting.

Confusion. Shouting. Blame.

He wishes he could see their faces.

06:23.

His Meshtastic buzzes:

"TEST FAILED. System locked. Emergency shutdown. Hoffmann losing his mind. Volkov demanding answers. - E"

Ryan exhales a breath he didn't know he was holding. It worked.

"Stay safe. Going dark until 07:30."

"Going dark. See you on the other side."

And then silence.

Quest: Prepare for the final phase
- Wait until 07:30 for simultaneous release
- Monitor news channels for any early leaks
- Be prepared for blowback once the story breaks

06:30.

One hour until the world learns about Project Echo.

One hour until everything changes.

Story part 20: The Reckoning
07:00.

Ryan watches the clock on his laptop. Right now, Eva Weber is walking into the BND field office in Osnabrück. A young IT analyst carrying a USB drive full of treason, corruption, and murder.

He wonders what she's feeling. Fear? Relief? Determination? Probably all three.

His finger hovers over the send button. Thirty minutes.

07:15.

The waiting is unbearable. He paces his mancave, checks the news feeds, refreshes his email. Nothing yet. No breaking alerts. No leaked stories.

He messages Cees: "Anything on emergency frequencies?"

"Increased chatter from the facility area. German, encrypted. Something's happening over there, but I can't make out what."

Ryan's stomach tightens. Increased chatter could mean anything. Security response to the failed test. Damage control. Or...

He forces the thought away. Eva knew the risks. They both did.

07:28.

Two minutes.

Ryan opens his email client. The draft is ready. Twenty-three recipients - investigative journalists, editors, researchers. Subject line: "PROJECT ECHO - URGENT - Russian Infiltration of German Military R&D."

He attaches the evidence package. 847 megabytes of documentation, logs, photos, timeline.

His heart pounds. Once he sends this, there's no taking it back. His name will be attached to one of the biggest leaks in European security history.

07:29.

One minute.

He thinks about his quiet life. The espressos. The coding projects. The boats on the canal. All of it will change after this.

He thinks about the people who died in "calibration accidents." Their families never got answers. Now they will.

07:30.

Ryan clicks send.

```
Sending to 23 recipients...
Message sent successfully.
```

It's done.

07:31.

His phone rings. Unknown number, German prefix.

He stares at it. Should he answer? Could be Eva confirming. Could be something else entirely.

He answers: "Yes?"

"Herr Weylant?" A woman's voice. Professional, clipped. "This is Agent Scholz, Bundesnachrichtendienst. Please do not be alarmed. We have Eva Weber in protective custody. She asked us to contact you."

Ryan's legs go weak. He sits down heavily. "Is she okay?"

"She's fine. She's cooperating fully. We've reviewed the initial materials she provided. They are... significant."

"I just sent everything to the press. Thirty seconds ago."

A pause. "We anticipated that. Fräulein Weber told us about your arrangement. Under the circumstances, we believe public disclosure will actually assist our investigation. Difficult to suppress evidence that's already in twenty newsrooms."

Smart. The BND is adapting, not fighting.

"What happens now?"

"Now we move fast. Director Hoffmann and the consultant Volkov are being detained as we speak. The Steckerdoser facility is being locked down. We have questions for you as well, Herr Weylant, but those can wait until the immediate threats are contained."

"Am I in trouble?"

Another pause. "You broke into a German military installation and sabotaged classified equipment. Under normal circumstances, yes, you would be in considerable trouble."

Ryan's heart sinks.

"However," Agent Scholz continues, "you also prevented a mass-casualty event and exposed a Russian intelligence operation that had penetrated our defense infrastructure. The Bundeskanzler's office has been briefed. My understanding is that... creative solutions are being discussed regarding your legal status."

Creative solutions. That's spy-speak for making a problem disappear.

"I appreciate that."

"Don't thank me yet. There will be debriefings. Extensive debriefings. The Netherlands AIVD will want to speak with you as well. And the Americans - the CIA is very interested in your documentation of Operation ZERFALL."

Of course they are.

"One more thing, Herr Weylant. Fräulein Weber asked me to pass along a message."

"What is it?"

"She said: 'The espresso is on me.'"

Despite everything, Ryan laughs.

08:15.

The news breaks.

Der Spiegel is first, with a banner headline: "RUSSISCHE INFILTRATION: Geheimes Waffenprogramm in deutscher Forschungseinrichtung aufgedeckt."

The Guardian follows: "Project Echo: How Russian agents built a chaos weapon inside a German military facility."

Bellingcat posts a detailed thread, already cross-referencing the leaked documents with their own investigations into Operation ZERFALL.

Within an hour, it's everywhere. BBC. CNN. NOS. ARD. Social media explodes. Politicians demand answers. The German defense minister announces an emergency parliamentary inquiry. The Russian embassy issues a terse denial.

And in a small farmhouse in Compascuum, Ryan Weylant watches history unfold on his laptop, drinking the strongest espresso he's ever made.

09:30.

His allies check in.

Cees: "You crazy bastard. You actually did it. The LOFAR guys are calling you a hero."

Jaap: "Told you the old underground still had some fight left. Drinks are on me when this settles down."

Chris Kubecka: "Nice work, Ryan. The OSINT community is going wild over these documents. You've given us enough material to keep digging for months. Volkov's network is bigger than just Germany - we're already finding connections in Poland, Czech Republic, maybe France. This is just the beginning."

Just the beginning. Ryan hadn't thought about that. Project Echo was one operation. Operation ZERFALL was one thread. How many more are there?

But that's a problem for another day.

11:00.

Two black cars pull into Ryan's driveway. Dutch plates. AIVD.

He watches from the window as four people in dark suits step out - three men and a woman. They don't look hostile, exactly. Just... official.

Ryan opens the door before they knock.

"Herr Weylant," the lead agent says. "Or should I say, Ryan. My name is Van der Berg. We have some questions. May we come in?"

Ryan steps aside. "Can I offer you an espresso?"

Van der Berg allows a thin smile. "That would be appreciated. It's been a long morning for all of us."

They sit in Ryan's kitchen, sipping espresso while the most surreal debrief of his life unfolds. They ask about the SSTV transmission. The USB drop. The Meshtastic communications. The infiltration.

Ryan tells them everything. There's no point in hiding now.

When he finishes, Van der Berg nods slowly. "You understand this is highly irregular. A Dutch citizen conducting an unsanctioned operation on German soil."

"I understand."

"The Germans want to give you a medal. Or arrest you. They can't decide which."

"And the Dutch?"

Van der Berg exchanges a glance with his colleagues. "We've been tracking Russian influence operations in the border region for years. We suspected something was happening at Steckerdoser but could never get proof. You handed us the entire case on a silver platter."

"So...?"

"So the official position of the AIVD is that you are a private citizen who received unsolicited information and acted in good faith to prevent harm to human life. Unofficially..." He leans forward. "We could use someone with your skills. If you're interested."

Ryan stares at him. "Are you recruiting me?"

"I'm suggesting that your talents might be better utilized with... institutional support. Think about it."

They leave their cards and drive away.

14:00.

Ryan finally sleeps. Three hours, fitful, full of dreams about transformer stations and golf carts and flickering SSTV patterns.

When he wakes, there are 247 unread emails. Interview requests. Media inquiries. Messages from people he hasn't heard from in decades.

He ignores them all except one.

From: eva.weber.private@protonmail.com
Subject: Thank you

```
Ryan,

I'm writing this from a BND safehouse somewhere in Bavaria. 
They won't tell me exactly where, but the coffee is terrible 
so it's definitely not Munich.

I wanted to thank you properly. When I sent that first SSTV 
transmission, I had no idea if anyone would receive it, let 
alone act on it. You could have ignored it. You could have 
dismissed it as a prank. You could have called the police 
and let them dismiss it too.

Instead, you believed. You investigated. You risked everything 
to do the right thing.

My father is safe. The BND picked him up this morning for 
"questioning" but really it's protective custody. Hoffmann 
had people watching him. If you hadn't done what you did 
last night, I don't know what would have happened to him. 
To both of us.

Volkov is in custody. Hoffmann too. The BND says they're 
cooperating - turns out neither of them wants to take the 
fall alone. They're giving up names, networks, operations. 
The whole ZERFALL structure is unraveling.

I don't know what happens next for me. More debriefings. 
Maybe testimony if there's a trial. A new identity, probably. 
You don't expose Russian intelligence operations and go back 
to normal life.

But I don't regret it. Not for a second.

I still owe you that espresso. Maybe someday, when all this 
settles down, I'll find my way to that little farmhouse by 
the canal. Until then, stay safe, stay paranoid, and keep 
that SSTV terminal running.

You never know who might be listening.

- E

P.S. I heard the AIVD made you an offer. You should take it. 
The world needs more people like you. People who see something 
wrong and refuse to look away.
```

Ryan reads the email three times. Then he saves it to an encrypted folder and closes his laptop.

Outside, the sun is setting over the canal. A boat drifts by, someone waving from the deck. Ryan waves back.

Normal life. Whatever that means now.

He looks at the AIVD business card on his desk. Van der Berg. Direct line.

His SSTV terminal hums quietly in the corner, receiving nothing but static.

For now.

Quest Complete: Project Echo Exposed
- Russian infiltration of Steckerdoser facility revealed
- Operation ZERFALL disrupted
- Hoffmann and Volkov in custody
- Lives saved in Groningen
- Eva Weber safe in protective custody

New Quest Available: The AIVD Offer
- Consider Van der Berg's recruitment proposal
- What does the future hold for Ryan Weylant?

THE END... for now.

---

EPILOGUE - Three months later

The Steckerdoser Heide facility has been shut down pending a complete security review. Seven German officials have been arrested in connection with Operation ZERFALL. The German parliament has passed new vetting requirements for defense contractors.

Dimitri Volkov is awaiting trial in a maximum-security prison outside Munich. He's refused to cooperate with German authorities but is reportedly negotiating with the Americans for a lighter sentence in exchange for information about other SPEKTR-derived programs.

Director Hoffmann made a full confession in exchange for witness protection. He's somewhere in Canada now, living under a new name, looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life.

Chris Kubecka published a report on Operation ZERFALL that traced Russian influence operations across seven European countries. It's become required reading at NATO intelligence agencies.

Cees went back to his LOFAR research but keeps his radio equipment tuned to interesting frequencies. Just in case.

Jaap Haartsen started a security consulting firm. His first client: a German defense contractor looking to improve their vetting procedures.

Eva Weber testified before a closed session of the German parliament. Her identity remains classified. Rumors say she's working for a European cybersecurity agency now, but no one can confirm it.

And Ryan Weylant?

He took the meeting with Van der Berg. Then another meeting. Then a training program in The Hague.

These days, when strange signals appear on his SSTV terminal, he doesn't investigate alone.

He has backup now.
