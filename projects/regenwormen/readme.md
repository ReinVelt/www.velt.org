# Regenwormen/Pickomino Learning Game

## Project Overview

This project is an educational implementation of the Regenwormen (Pickomino) board game, created as part of a learning process to understand game mechanics and algorithms before tackling a larger assignment.

## Background & Purpose

**Author**: Rein Velt  
**Context**: Assignment preparation for Dawn Technology  
**Objective**: Understanding Regenwormen/Pickomino game mechanics and logic

### Why This Project Exists

I received an assignment from Dawn Technology involving Regenwormen/Pickomino algorithms. Since I was unfamiliar with the game rules and strategy, I needed a hands-on approach to understand the problem space before developing efficient algorithms.

This implementation serves as:
- **Step 1**: Problem comprehension and game mechanics exploration
- **Learning Tool**: Interactive way to understand game flow, decision points, and strategic elements
- **Foundation**: Base knowledge for approaching the actual assignment requirements

## Project Status

🚧 **This is NOT the final solution** 🚧

This code represents an initial exploration phase, not the end result of the Dawn Technology assignment. The actual assignment work will begin after:

1. ✅ **Current Phase**: Understanding game mechanics through this implementation
2. 🎯 **Next Steps**: Playing the physical game this weekend for deeper insight
3. 📁 **Future Work**: Analyzing the provided `regenwormen.zip` file next week
4. 🎯 **Final Goal**: Developing the efficient algorithm solution for Dawn Technology

## Technical Implementation

- **Single HTML File**: Complete game implementation with embedded CSS/JS
- **Development Time**: ~1.5 hours with AI assistance
- **Tools Used**: VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Claude Sonnet 4
- **Features**: Human vs AI gameplay, strategic hints, animated interface

## Game Features

- Interactive Regenwormen/Pickomino gameplay
- Strategic computer opponent with balanced difficulty
- Visual dice animations and effects
- Contextual strategic hints and tips
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Animated character guide system

## Development Philosophy

This project follows a **"learn by building"** approach - creating a functional implementation to deeply understand the problem before optimizing solutions. The focus is on comprehension rather than efficiency at this stage.

## Documentation

- **[ai-queries.md](./ai-queries.md)** - Optimized 4-step AI instruction guide for efficiently recreating the enhanced game

## Next Steps

1. **Weekend**: Physical gameplay sessions for strategic understanding
2. **Next Week**: Analysis of official Dawn Technology materials
3. **Future**: Application of learned insights to assignment requirements
